# mabuc
Simulation code for reference with MABUC article: Bareinboim, Forney, &amp; Pearl (2015)

This MATLAB script (bandit_comparison.m) compares the performance of a variety of bandit algorithms across several parameterizations of the MABUC scenario as laid out in Bareinboim, Forney, & Pearl (2015). Read the instructions within bandit_comparison.m to configure the MABUC simulations and display their results.

For simulation configuration instructions, consult the documentation in bandit_comparison.m.

Please feel free to use the code as you wish (but under your own responsibility!).
